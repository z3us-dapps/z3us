# Migrate accounts for Babylon Network Upgrade

We at the Z3US team are committed to elevating the Radix DLT wallet experience and deeply appreciate your support throughout this endeavor.
Here are some key points as the Radix network upgrades to babylon:

- Z3US Wallet Compatibility: After the network update, the Z3US wallet will not immediately work with the babylon network. However, we have an upcoming Z3US wallet update that will ensure compatibility.
- Account Access: During this interim period, you can seamlessly migrate your accounts from Z3US to the Radix Mobile Wallet to ensure uninterrupted access.
- Z3US Extension: keep the extension installed so you do not need to re-import accounts when the Z3US babylon upgrade arrives 🚀.

Stay tuned for a comprehensive roadmap outlining the upcoming Z3US wallet updates, providing transparency and insight into the evolution of our wallet.

Thank you for your trust and support as we work diligently to provide an amazing wallet experience with Radix DLT. We are committed to a smooth and secure transition to the Babylon network upgrade. For migration instructions, please read below:
